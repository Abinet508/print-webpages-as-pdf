# ```print-webpages-as-pdf```

> you can generate a PDF file right from your web browser without installing any third-party tool, by simply choosing to print to PDF instead of a printer.This may be enough for some use cases but it's far from being satisfactory when the number of pages to print increase. in that case you might need to switch to automation.
> I tried some of the libraries like pdfkit but the don't let you convert webpages to pdf when the page need authentication.
> This script allow you to export any webpages including pages that need autentications to PDF files using Python
